# Cedar Gallery
Cedar Gallery is a boutique, Tunisian, artisanal shop located in Fairlawn, Ohio. They sell beautiful, handmade goods imported from Tunisia. I recently had the pleasure of creating a website for Alex, the owner of Cedar Gallery, and that site is now live at [www.cedar&#x2011;gallery.com](https://cedar-gallery.com) for you to go check out some of her products and find out more about her story!

Be sure to check back regularly because there are more exciting things in store for Cedar Gallery. An updated version of the website is coming soon and will include an online store, allowing you to shop the unique and beautiful products from home! This should make Christmas shopping a breeze this year!
