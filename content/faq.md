These are just a few of the most common questions I get. If your question is not answered here please feel free to [contact me](/contact/). I will respond as quickly as I can.

## 1. CAN YOU MAKE A WEBSITE FOR ME?

Yes! I can build you a brand new website that will look great on any screen, from a full size desktop monitor down to your phone. If you already have a website that is outdated I can optimize it for the mobile web and make it look great again. [Contact me](/contact/) for pricing.

## 2. CAN YOU MAKE AN APP FOR ME?

Yes! I am currently focused on building Android apps, but if you have an idea and it needs to run both I can build a version for iPhone as well. If you need an app for your business or you have a great idea for a new app but you don't have the experience to build it, lets partner!

## 3. WILL YOU SHARE MY IDEA WITH ANYONE?

Absolutely not. If you come to me with an idea for an app or website idea I will never share it with anyone. I respect your ideas as your property, and even if we don't end up working together on that idea I will never share it with anyone.

## 4. WHAT ARE YOUR RATES?

Send me an [email](/contact/) and I will be happy to discuss pricing.
