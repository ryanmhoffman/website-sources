&lt;h1 id=&#34;rmh-trucking-small-sample-site&#34;&gt;RMH Trucking Small Sample Site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to change up my focus a little bit from &amp;ldquo;Android Development&amp;rdquo; or even more general with &amp;ldquo;Mobile Development&amp;rdquo;
and focus on web development. I decided that I was going to try solve a problem I am very familiar with, terrible or non-existing
websites for trucking companies. Even more specifically than that, websites that are outdated and not mobile friendly for
trucking companies that specialize in liquid bulk transportation. I got the idea from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://entrepreneurs.maqtoob.com/how-to-get-jobs-on-freelance-sites-even-if-you-have-zero-experience-6df6a660ff1b&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
that you can check out, but it basically says to be highly specialized instead of highly generalized in order to better compete
as a freelancer. That is when I realized that I am intimately familiar with trucking companies and many have terrible or no websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created RMH Trucking as a sample of what I can do. It is called RMH Trucking Small because it is the &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; offering I have.
I will also be creating a RMH Trucking Medium and RMH Trucking Large for those companies looking for more comprehensive sites.
For now you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/RMHTruckingSmall&#34;&gt;RMH Trucking Small here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance&#34;&gt;The Importance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site and the others once created will offer a look and design like they are modern, but they will more importantly scale
well for mobile devices. The most common thing I see is a slightly outdated desktop site that isn&amp;rsquo;t terrible, but on mobile
it becomes completely unusable. My sites will be completely mobile friendly, look great, and will be customizable to match
the brand of any company. Also, they will be optomized to rank highly in search engines so potential new customers and
drivers can find the company and easily get in contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will come back and update this with the other sample sites once they are created, so stay tuned for those updates. If you
are looking to have a site built or redesigned for your trucking company (or any other company), feel free to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/contact/&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me for more details!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can React Native compare and compete with true native code?</title>
      <link>https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2018/01/28/react-native/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-write-this-article&#34;&gt;Why Write this Article?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great question, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked! First, let me say that this is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; going to be a
benchmarking article to compare numbers and load times or anything like that. This article
is going to be a look into whether a developer who currently works using native code for
either or both mobile platforms should consider React Native. I am writing this article
because that is the position I find myself in currently. I am a native Android developer;
I love Kotlin and Java and I am very comfortable developing Android apps. I have some
experience with iOS, but I find it much less enjoyable, and I am not nearly as comfortable
with Swift as I am with Kotlin and Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would I look at React Native when I&amp;rsquo;m already a native developer? In reality, I&amp;rsquo;ve
been looking for a way to be able to write an application that can share a majority of its
code on multiple platforms. I was hopeful that Kotlin could fill that requirement, and it
looks like this is still promising with transpiling to JavaScript and to native code that
can be run with c code, but it is not near ready yet and also still very complicated. So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-react-native&#34;&gt;Enter React Native&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what React Native is, it&amp;rsquo;s a framework developed by Facebook that allows
you to build native apps for both Android and iOS using JavaScript. Yes, it is cross
platform, and yes, it really is native code. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details of how it works,
but it really does make truly native apps, not hybrid or just webviews. React Native lets
you write &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; all of your code in JavaScript, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; it lets you share the majority
of that code across both platforms. This is exactly what I was looking for so I decided to
give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-learning-curve&#34;&gt;The Learning Curve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was only one small problem: I didn&amp;rsquo;t know JavaScript. Not only did I not know
JavaScript, but I thought I hated it. I had limited exposure to it in passing, but no real
experience with it. But I had heard plenty of horror stories about its quirks and
inconsistencies to know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me. I decided to put my preconcieved notions about
the language aside and approach both React Native and JavaScript with an open mind. And
guess what I found? I&amp;hellip;loved it! Yes, I actually enjoyed JavaScript almost immediately
after spending a couple hours truly messing around in it. It was easy to pick up, had lots
of examples and tutorials, and seemed intuitive to use to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main method of learning was just to start with the official React Native docs, which
are fantastic by the way, and move all the way through their documentation. I got through
that in about an hour and felt I had a decent grasp of the concept, but I needed more
practice, so I went in search of a tutorial with some basic ideas like retrieving data
from an API, parsing JSON, and making an app that could actually be useful. In less than a
day I felt I had a good enough understanding to work on a real (small) project. That is
an incredible thing to think about, considering I knew neither React Native nor JavaScript
before this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-native-part&#34;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Native&lt;/em&gt; Part&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to this point, I learned something new that blew my mind. I understood that
React Native creates real Android Studio and Xcode projects, but it hadn&amp;rsquo;t dawned on me
that I could actualy open them and put native code in the projects there. This is
important because while React Native is very good, it does not have all of the elements of
a truly native app. Some more complex or less used components are left out (for now.) By
being able to still write Kotlin in the Android project and Swift in the Xcode project,
yet having all logic and much of the UI rendered from a single JavaScript source, I could
get the 100% native code base I was looking for with a single, shared codebase for both
mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-i-am-going-from-here&#34;&gt;Where I am Going From Here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an expert in React Native or JavaScript. I have only been using it a
little over a week at the time I am writing this, but I plan to continue on this path. It
can cut down my development time dramatically by allowing me to share code across
platforms, and that could be a big selling feature to clients. It will also allow me to
create much better iOS apps which are currently my weak point, because I can use more
JavaScript and less Swift. I think in the long run this will not only help me become a
better developer, but it will provide value to my future clients by decreasing development
time and saving them money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future once I have spent more time with both new technologies (to me) I may provide
an update on whether my thoughts have changed at all or if I have any new opinions on the
topics. Until next time, happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nearly 8 Months with Vim</title>
      <link>https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2017/12/27/update-on-vim/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-i-feel-about-vim-now&#34;&gt;How I Feel About Vim Now&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a follow up on a post I wrote several months ago about my starting point with Vim. If you missed that post, you can
read it &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2017/04/28/getting-started-with-vim/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That details how and when I started with Vim nearly 8 months ago.
Now it is an integral part of my workflow. It is my only text editor, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I lived without it before. The intention
isn&amp;rsquo;t to preach Vim here and force it on anyone; I am merely chronicling my adventures in learning this editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-use-vim&#34;&gt;How I use Vim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim is my general text editor now, used for pretty much everything but Java and Kotlin (Android development). I use it for
Python, editing my configs, even writing this post in Markdown. I have personalized my vimrc a little bit, but it is actually
still very small. I use a few plugins too, but again they are very few. I have found that Vim does a lot of things that many
people might not know about and try to use plugins for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond jusing actual Vim in the terminal, I also have begun using plugins wherever possible to add Vim bindings to different
applications. I have added IdeaVim to Intellij Idea and Android Studio to configure as many keys as possible to behave like
Vim. It is very good, but not perfect. It definitely is good enough to recommend to about any Vim user out there. I also use
Vimium extension in Vivaldi, my browser. It is an extension for Chrome technically, but since Vivaldi is based on the
chromium open source project same as Chrome, the extensions mostly work on it. Vimium uses many of the navigation key bindings
from Vim and adds some to help with link navigation etc. It makes it possible to use the broswer mostly without a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-vim-configuration&#34;&gt;My Vim Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Vim config is pretty small, but it does have some changes, almost none are unique to me. I find things from other people&amp;rsquo;s
configs and use them, just like everyone else does. Some big changes I have made are remapping the escape key to jj. Other
than typing it right there, I have never had to type two j&amp;rsquo;s together before, so it is a safe string to use. It is on the
home row so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to stretch for escape every time I want to exit insert mode. For plugins, I have added Nerdtree
for easy file navigation, I added YouCompleteMe code completion engine, and I have added powerline. I use relative line
numbers for easy jumping from line to line. The last customizations I made are just visual, I use syntax highlighting and
the color scheme I have set is darcula, which looks like the theme of the same name in Jetbrains IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-i-m-going-from-here&#34;&gt;Where I&amp;rsquo;m Going From Here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim is my main editor now, and I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself switching any time soon. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I will never try something else,
but I have become so much more productive with Vim that it feels like a waste to use anything else now. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be
a vim evangelist, preaching it to all. It simply is the best editor for me and my workflow. That does not mean it is for
everyone, nor should it be. I might make tutorials some day about Vim, but for now, I am just a happy user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started with Vim</title>
      <link>https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2017/04/28/getting-started-with-vim/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:47:08 +0200</pubDate>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-started-with-vim&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Vim&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this article might be misleading a little bit, but this is not a tutorial about how to get started with Vim.
It is in fact a small post about my decision to get started with Vim. I recently made the decision to start using Vim as
my main (read only) editor. I decided that I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it a try for 37 days, and after that I will see if I like it
and if it makes me any more productive than with my current editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-point&#34;&gt;Starting Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than a minimal knowledge of what Vim was, I knew nothing about using it or how to get started. I installed it on all
my machines about 3 days ago, and now I&amp;rsquo;m already using it full time. I&amp;rsquo;m still very slow, I have to look up commands about
every other minute, and I constantly stop to tweak my .vimrc but I&amp;rsquo;m learning quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start with a blank slate. I used a pure vanilla install of Vim, and I created a blank .vimrc as a starting point.
I wanted to follow the advice that said you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t start with someone else&amp;rsquo;s configuration, and don&amp;rsquo;t put anything in your
.vimrc that you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. It&amp;rsquo;s working for me so far, but as I mentioned I&amp;rsquo;ve only been using it for a few days now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-commands&#34;&gt;Basic Commands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the basics down for navigation through the file, and basic editing with delete, copy/paste and insert. I&amp;rsquo;m trying my
best stay in normal mode as much as possible and only switch to insert mode when necessary. It&amp;rsquo;s slower for me right now, but
I can already see how it will get faster once I get the commands into my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-i-m-going-from-here&#34;&gt;Where I&amp;rsquo;m Going From Here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to only use Vim for the next 30 days. At the end of May, I&amp;rsquo;m going to post an update on whether I plan
to stick with Vim, and either way I&amp;rsquo;m going to give my complete and honest thoughts on using it. I will explain how it made me
more or less productive and if it was worth learning all the commands and keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that I have installed IdeaVim plugin for Intellij IDEA and Android Studio. I do the majority of my
development in Android Studio since I&amp;rsquo;m an Android developer, so I figured to really double down and get the full experience
I need Vim everywhere. Stay tuned for the update next month and happy Vimming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review of Github Projects</title>
      <link>https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2016/12/06/github-projects-vs-trello/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2016 13:47:08 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/blog/2016/12/06/github-projects-vs-trello/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;github-projects-vs-trello&#34;&gt;Github Projects vs Trello&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-projects/&#34;&gt;Github Projects&lt;/a&gt;
until recently. Projects was designed to help teams organize their work and implement their own workflow
directly within Github. The goal was to make it flexible and customizable so it could be useful for any
workflow, team, or project, and to make it a part of Github so developers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need a new tool to
install and configure and so they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to leave Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I heard about Projects I looked into it to see if it could be of any use to me. After a few minutes
with it I had mixed feelings. Honestly it looks promising and it even seems to be useful right now, but it
felt like a very unashamed copy of Trello but without many of the features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/img/banners/banner-github-projects.png&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: 100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, it is a project management app used for team
collaboration and customizable workflow implementation. Sound familiar? The layout on Trello is list
based; you define lists, and within each list you can add cards. As you work on the cards you can drag
them between the lists to mean different things depending on your setup, and you can do all sorts of other
things like comment on cards, assign users to cards, set due dates and dozens of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ryanmhoffman.github.io/img/banners/trello.png&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: 100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-github-projects-is-useful&#34;&gt;How Github Projects is Useful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though admittedly I didn&amp;rsquo;t fall in love with Projects right away, I did find it useful enough to
begin using in some of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Since I had been using Trello for a while the UI was
familiar and easy to jump into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently building an app called Friends that I am using Projects with. Friends is basically a
contacts app, but it is only for your starred contacts. My workflow in Projects looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO: A list of cards with features/bugs/ideas to be implemented eventually.
Queue: This list is usually only 1 card, it is the next item I plan to work on.
In Progress: List of items I am currently working on.
Completed: Once I finish a card it gets moved to the completed list - yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see this is a very simple workflow, but it is easy to manage and it helps my stay organized.
With Projects, adding new lists and cards is as simple as clicking the &amp;ldquo;add&amp;rdquo; button and typing the name or
content. Once you have a card you can easily turn it into an Issue, link Pull Request, or other git
functions. I do like the fact that it is built in to Github also, so it is part of your repository and you
can access and use it without leaving Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I liked about it was that you can have more than one Project for a repository. You could
have a global project to track the progress of the whole repository, then other sub-projects for different
modules or features or really however you wanted to break it down. It seems like a good way for a manager
to track several teams or developers a bit more individually without it being too much of a nuisance.
Finally there are Organization wide Projects, which can be used to track multiple repositories within an
 organization profile. Unfortunately this is about where the features end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-github-projects-falls-short&#34;&gt;How Github Projects Falls Short&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I have is that there is no way to comment on cards, which seems like it should be
basic functionality. I don&amp;rsquo;t always want to turn a card into an issue solely so I can go there and
comment on the progress. I wish I could just open the card within Projects and comment on it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
used projects with a team yet, but I imagine this would be even more useful in a team setting. I can&amp;rsquo;t
see a reason why Github would leave this functionality out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another noticeably lacking feature was labels. It would be nice to be able to add a label to certain
cards so you could quickly see visually which cards are related. I understand that cards could be grouped
in columns, but in my case that would add more columns and more clutter to a very simple workflow. Github
already has labels in their issue tracking section so I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should be too difficult to add to
Projects. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it&amp;rsquo;s not there to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I noticed that is missing doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually affect me, but I think it would be useful in a
team. That is assigning a user to a card. This would help everyone know what everyone else is doing and
prevent overlap on certain cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just spoiled from Trello since all of these features are included, but it almost feels like
Projects is a stripped down version of Trello. I think Github could make this so much better and more
useful, and honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why they didn&amp;rsquo;t. What they released feels like it was rushed into
production. I hope they update it and continue to add features to make it more useful. In its current
state it does have value, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t where it could or should be. I will continue to use it in this
basic form, but my main project management is going to remain with Trello.&lt;/p&gt;
